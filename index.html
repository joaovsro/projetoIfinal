      <p>This website is part of a academic project divided in three chapters, exploring basic concepts about visual narratives and their relationship with new media, considering their potential to deal with sociopolitical issues in a world where digital technology is present in our everyday lives.</p>

       <p> Here you’ll find the links to the projects cited in the printed version, available on PDF, and some excerpts connecting them to the main text.</p>
        <br>
        The three parts are:
        <p><b>I. the importance of visual narratives<br>II. living in the post-digital context<br>III. Sociopolitical challenges for new narratives.</b></p>

    <div class="section-content">
      <p><div class='head1'>I.I. what are visual narratives?</div>
        <p><div class='citations'>"Andreas Sudmann stresses that “[t]he narrative ‘script’ of a game is not just ‘given’ for us to read or watch; instead,
        it is generated on the fly, in the moment of interaction between the game and the player.” [29] In the same way,
        machine vision, as the undirected outcome of the endowment of technology with sensing capacities, can make visible
        films that nobody knew we were watching, or games that nobody knew we were playing[30]".<br><b>—visual storytelling: the art and the technique (2010),</br></b></div></p>

        <p><div class='head1'>I.II. which visual narratives?</div></p>
        <p><div class='citations'>Film and television is delivered to the masses, without even the slightest participation from the audience (not very real, per se). There are alternatives, which provided more nominal degrees of linearism, such as silent films, comics and interactive games. However, an interactive game is not completely linear, when there are different paths and outcomes to the game. True, if consistently taking a specific path into the new world, that can be construed as linear but the initial experience overall is not.<br><b>—visual storytelling: the art and the technique (2010),</br></b></div></p>

        <p><div class='citations'>"Another quality of enduring prose is realism through observation, a naturalistic approach to the details and texture of everyday life. In a medium associated with escapism, any concession to the real world may be striking. When depicting everyday events, comic writers face many of the same challenges and prose writers — capturing the detail and subtlety of human activity, and being brave enough to show readers the whole pictures, however discomforting the results. The visual approach to realism again offers challenges unique to comics, 
          and a variety of approaches has been tried. From the direct approach comics artist may choose to depict their worlds at a nearly photographic level of detail using traditional media, computer graphics or actual photos.<br><b>—reinventing comics

      <p><div class='head1'>II.I. the 'new media art'</div></p>
      <p><div class='citations'>According
        to Manovich, “new media” became a conceptual category
        when computers first began to be used not only to
        produce, but also to store and distribute contents.
        New Media is therefore the result of the encounter
        between two technologies which came into being in the
        same period: mass media and data processing.
        This encounter changed the identity of the media as
        much as that of the computer, transformed from simple
        calculator into a “media processor”. <br><b>— beyond new media art

        <p><div class='citations'>"The possibilities for these transformations, alternative methods of viewing “media” which essentially amounts
          toan arbitrary assemblage of data, has thus far been most thoroughly examined in the field of “information
          aesthetics,” a field as distanced from Post-Internet art as it is close to design, cartography, and indexing. Its
          fault is in its attempt to encapsulate large amounts of
          data—practical information, experience—into an
          aesthetic and understandable shorthand. In other words,
          information aesthetics provides in one object both a
          representation and the components which make up its
          source in an attempt to illustrate or arrive at knowledge.</div></p>

          <p><div class='head1'>II.III. the web as a communal space</div></p>
          <p><div class='citations'>"Increasingly though, mass media and the world of “the screen” is our communal space. And with it comes new
            fragments with their own particular hierarchies. As
            reader-authors navigating these fragments, where now
            would we find a space within which to delineate “art”?
            Or, if the new “mass media” is as distributed and varied
            as our social networks themselves, and in fact driven by them, is that delineation even necessary? Ironically, the
            most radical and “progressive” movements of the Post-
            Internet period would be those who either pass by either
            largely unnoticed due to a decision to opt out of any easily-accessible distribution networks, or else would be
            composed of a community of people producing cultural objects not intended as artistic propositions and not
            applying themselves with the label of artist.</div></p>

            of a link, a post, a picture, or a movie to the attention
            of a user appears to near systematically favor the
            noteworthy aberration over the generic or the everyday.
            As we’ve argued elsewhere, the platform supplements
            hues of intensity, drama, rage, and heroism to this dull
            normality. [40] Something of this is to the effect of an electronic
